        		<h1>A little about me</h1>
				<p>I'm a data-driven professional with an extensive background in higher education. Throughout my career I've worked mostly in international education, managing education abroad opportunities for students in locations all over the world. I've engaged in risk management, crisis management, developing training, assessment and evaluation, and diversity and inclusion work within my capacity as an international educator.  
        </p>
			<p>In addition, data analysis has been an integral part of my work. By analyzing and visualizing data, I seek to gain insights into problems and work on solutions backed by relevant findings. I've worked individually and in teams to find data-backed solutions to multi-faceted issues.
			I am particularly interested in (and excited about!) analyzing textual data, or text mining. I have analyzed textual data using machine learning classification, lexicon based sentiment analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling. I am constantly finding new ways to <s>get in trouble</s> utilize text mining methods that are fun, interesting, and useful to extract actionable insights from large corpora of textual data.</p>
			
			<p>I am also skilled in project management, having lead several projects such as creating mobile apps and building learning and training experiences. I've done coursework in instructional design and have experience as an LX designer, using an iterative process to create useful, lean, and relevant content to address the specific needs of learners.</p>
