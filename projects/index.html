			<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
				<h3><a href="https://github.com/sorayaworldwide/twitterclassification" target="_blank">Classification of Twitter Sentiment: Covid-19, Vaccines, and Education</a></h3>
					<p>This machine learning project sought to classify the sentiment of tweets based on textual characteristics of the data. The analysis was conducted in R using the <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank">TidyModels framework</a> and multinomial regression. The project was heavily influenced by Emil Hvitfelt and Julia Silge's excellent resource <cite><a href="https://smltar.com/" target="_blank">Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R</cite></a>. 
					</p>
					<p>Below you will find several plots illustrating the findings of the classification project based on specific features.</p>

			<h2>Dashboard Design</h2>

					<p>This simple dashboard shows the total international student enrollment in US Universities as compared to the total of all university students enrolled in the US.  The US has seen steady growth in the number of International Students enrolled in its universities since 1980 until 2016. The data show that the number took a slight decline since then, coinciding with the unfavorable policies of the Trump administration. <a href="https://github.com/sorayaworldwide/shinyopendoors" target="_blank">Link to Git Repo</a>
