title: "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in IE: A Chat with Rochelle Newton, Ed.D."
date: 2021-09-26

It's been a year since I [virtually sat down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gl6f94kdew) with [Dr. Rochelle Newton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drrochellenewton) for one of her Diversity Chats to speak about my experience working in international education. At the time, the country and our field were experiencing alot of upheaval (and still does), and I expressed my concern and wishes for both in regards to diversity and inclusion. A year out, I've been reflecting on our conversation. With the field of international education beginning to 'restart' after the pandemic, it should not lose a huge opportunity to put DEI at the forefront for reimagining what we do. IE should create programs, workplaces, and opportunities that prioritizes anti-racism and have DEI at the core of its mission – it only makes sense and is critical for espousing the tenants of a truly global education.

I want to thank Rochelle for including a person from IE in her chats. If you haven’t already, please check out her [diversity chats](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkyawZ1jIpKyagv56kwDCVg) with other professionals from different industries.
