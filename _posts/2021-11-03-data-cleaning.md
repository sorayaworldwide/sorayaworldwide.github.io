There's a wealth of information on data, data analysis, and tips and tricks of the trade out there. The R community in particular is extremely active and there are many free, open-sourced resources to help people along the way. One particular resource I came across recently is [Data Management in Large Scale Educational Research](https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/index.html) by Crystal Lewis. 

<p>In particular, the section ['Data Cleaning Plan'](https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_4.html) gives an excellent overview on an often overlooked aspect of data analysis - namely, data cleaning or processing! Anyone who works with data will tell you that 80% of their time is spent cleaning and transforming data before any real analysis can begin. I've seen in many data analysis programs or online courses, the time is most focused on using functions, code, and visualization. However, good data analysis starts with clean, usable data. Here's a good infographic of the data analysis cycle taken from this [Medium article by Durgesh Anand](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/learn-data-science-using-crisp-dm-framework-473960b2da90)
