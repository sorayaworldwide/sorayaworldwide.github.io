title: "Animated Word Cloud in R using ggplot and gganimate"

Ever since being introduced to R in my Learning Analytics program, I've been a huge fan. One of my favorite things to do is play around with visualizations using `ggplot`. For one of my projects analyzing word usage between Duke University, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State University's respective Twitter accounts, I used an animated world cloud to show the frequency of word usage through time in a one year snap shot. The year was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, so you'll see the evolution of most frequently tweeted words nicely through use of `gganimate`.
