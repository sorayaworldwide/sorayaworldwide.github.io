My colleagues [Paul Paparella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-paparella-154a008/), [Blase Scarnati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blasescarnati/), and I collaborated on the following article about foregrounding social justice in study abroad. Experiential education programs like study abroad need to be actively anti-racist and broaden its reach by incorporating innovative program design, including local-global programming, virtual options, and strengthening community engagement. Check it out via the higher education online newspaper, [Evolllution.](https://evolllution.com/revenue-streams/global_learning/study-abroad-has-never-lived-up-to-its-own-social-justice-aspirations/)
