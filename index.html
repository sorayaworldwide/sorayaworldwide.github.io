        		<h1>Hello, world! I'm Soraya Campbell</h1>
				<p>I'm a data-driven, creative problem solver with an extensive background in higher education. 
					By day, I'm Assistant Director in the Global Education Office at Duke University. However, I also have considerable experience analyzing and visualizing data, 
					managing projects, managing distributed and international teams, and designing learning experiences. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
			
				<p>I seek to educate and inform through insights gained by exploration of data and by smart learning design - and to have some fun while doing it. &#128526;</p>
